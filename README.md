## :question: Get Help

 For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug: 

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] **PayPal**— You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on using Brave Browser][badge_brave]][brave] **Brave**— It's free for you. Brave is a browser that improves the security and the access time of websites by blocking ads, trackers and scripts. Give the new Brave Browser a try and Brave will contribute to me on your behalf. :wink:
 - [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/T6T412CXA) **Ko-fi**— I'll buy a ~~tea~~ coffee. :coffee: :wink:
 - ![](./examples/bitcoin.png) **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code): `3KDjCmXsGFYawmycXRsVwfFbphog117N8P`
 

Thanks! :heart:
